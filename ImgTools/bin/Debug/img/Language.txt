; Lesson 1 (Lesson 1°³´ç ÃÖ´ë 200°³ ¹®ÀÚ¿­)	
2001000	Welcome to the mysterious planet "Lond" where eight moons rise.
2001001	Hi, Nice to meet you! My name is Rena!
2001002	My goal is to train Gunbound newbies so that they can hang with all the pros.
2001003	In Gunbound, you will be participating in battles on your own personal mobile.
2001004	It's a dangerous but fun game. All you need to do is shoot your enemies and knock them off the map!
2001005	I'll be teaching you tons of stuff while we travel around the eight moons!
2001006	At the end of each lesson, I'll give you a big reward so don't give up!
2001007	Now, let's get started!
2001008	Let's talk about angles first. The angle tells you how high you are going to shoot!
2001009	You will see a number in the box at the bottom. That's your current angle.
2001010	The number changes as your angle changes.
2001011	This arrow tells you where your shots will go. This gives you a rough idea of the direction and height.
2001012	You can control the angle with your keyboard. Press ¡è arrow key to raise and ¡é arrow key to lower your angle.
2001013	Let's try changing the angle? Practicing setting your angle.
2001014	Let's set the angle to 50, then 15 and finally 30.
2001015	Your angle is too high! Press the ¡é arrow key and lower it a bit.
2001016	Your angle is too low! Press the ¡è arrow key and raise it a bit.
2001017	Good job! Don't forget, use the ¡è and ¡é arrow keys to change your angle.
2001018	Now that you know about angle, let's learn power. You will see a long bar at the bottom of the screen.
2001019	This bar indicates the power of your shots. Press, hold and release the space bar to control your power.
2001020	The power bar fills up as you hold down the space bar.
2001021	You see the power bar getting filled up in red? Your shots get stronger as the power bar fills up.
2001022	The power of your shots depend on how much the power bar is filled.
2001023	The power bar marker helps you control your power better.
2001024	If you click anywhere on the power bar the power bar marker moves there.
2001025	Now have a go at it yourself. Fill up the power to where the power bar maker is.
2001026	Fire your shot, filling up the power to where the power bar marker is.
2001027	Too much power! Release the space bar a little sooner.
2001028	Too little power! Hold down the space bar a little longer.
2001029	Well done! Remember, you need to control your power to have your shots land where you want them to!
2001030	Now let's see how you move your mobile. Your mobile has the ability to move around also.
2001031	You can move from your spot to avoid getting hit or to find better shooting angles.
2001032	The better you position yourself, the better your chances of winning. Press the ¡ç or ¡æ arrows to move your mobile.
2001033	When you move, you will see the blue gauge on the bottom go down.
2001034	Once the gauge runs out, you can't move anymore, so be careful.
2001035	Now let's give it a try! Move your mobile to the designated point.
2001036	Your movement range for each turn is limited so be careful.
2001037	Press F8 or click the skip button on the bottom of your screen to skip the rest of your turn.
2001038	Move to where the yellow marker is.
2001039	Just a little more to go! Cheer up!
2001040	Not that way! The other way!
2001041	You can no longer move! Press F8 to end this turn.
2001042	Good job! What do you think of that? Each mobile has a different movement range so keep that in mind!
2001043	Now let's talk about special items.
2001044	See that space? Those are the item slots. You can load up items in the game room before the game starts.
2001045	Your item inventory has six slots. Each item has different effects and requires a different number of slots.
2001046	To use an item, you can either left click the item or press a hot key.
2001047	Hot keys are from F1 to F6. You can use items quickly by pressing the hot keys.
2001048	There are two types of items:  general items and expendable items.
2001049	General items need to be loaded in the game room before the game starts. There are usually no restrictions.
2001050	Expendable items need be purchased by G Coin or Gold in the avatar shop. You can also load them in the game room.
2001051	Expendable items have special powers unlike other general items.
2001052	You can choose which type of item by pressing the tab above the items.
2001053	Let's try using an item. Use an item, then shoot.
2001054	Click on an item or press the corresponding hot key to use that item.
2001055	You need to use the item first!
2001056	You used the dual item that lets you fire two shots in one turn. Remember, each item has different effects! 
2001057	Finally, that last thing for this lesson. Delay!
2001058	Delay is a consequence of your turn.
2001059	Your delay increases as you use special shots or items. Your delay determines your next turn.
2001060	The higher your delay, the later your next turn will be.
2001061	This is how you can control the game. Check the delay for all players on the bottom of your screen.
2001062	You can see your delay and when your next turn will be!
2001063	Now get ready for a pop quiz on delay!
2001064	Get the answer right!
2001065	Which user will get to go first?
2001066	1. User A : Delay 700
2001067	2. User B : Delay 1300
2001068	3. User C : Delay 1000
2001069	4. User D : Delay 1500
2001070	Correct! Whoever has the lowest delay gets to go first!
2001071	I'm sorry, that's incorrect. Check the tip and answer again.
2001072	Wrong answer! Try again.
2001073	Incorrect! Check the tip and try again.
2001074	You've learned a lot! Get your rewards! Take the next lesson and get more rewards!
; Lesson 2	
2001200	Let's talk about what types of shots the mobiles can use and what true angle is.
2001201	Each mobile has three different kinds of shots.  The type of shot your are using is shown in the bottom left.
2001202	Shot 1, Shot 2 and SS all have different features.
2001203	Shot 1 is a regular shot.  Using shot 2 fires a special shot.
2001204	SS is the ultimate shot. It's really strong and special, but it also has a high delay.
2001205	Unlike other shots, the SS shot takes four turns to unlock before it can be used.
2001206	Now try firing your SS shot! Click the SS tab or press tab key twice.
2001207	Fire the SS shot!
2001208	Wait a few more turns. Press F8 to skip your turn!
2001209	Four turns have passed. You can use your SS shot now! Hurry!
2001210	Now you've seen the power of SS! SS is really strong but it also has high delay! Be careful when using it!
2001211	There are two types of angles you can use: true angle and untrue angle.
2001212	True angle gives you full damage while untrue angle gives you a little less, but extended angle range.
2001213	How do you tell the difference? The dark green area represents the true angle and the light green area represents the untrue angle.
2001214	Ok, time for another pop quiz!
2001215	Get the answer right!
2001216	What is the term for the type angle that gives your shot full power?
2001217	1. True Angle
2001218	2. Light Angle
2001219	3. Alternate Angle
2001220	4. Vertical Angle
2001221	Correct! Try to use the true angle to give your enemies maximum damage!
2001222	Nice try, but that is wrong.  Please try again.
2001223	Wrong answer! Check the tip and answer again.
2001224	That is incorrect! Please try again.
; Lesson 3	
2001400	Now let's see how the wind and forces affect your shots.
2001401	The wind is a main factor that determines the direction of your shots.
2001402	The wind indicator tells you where the wind is coming from and how strong it is.
2001403	The arrow tells you the direction of the wind and the number tells you how strong the wind is.
2001404	Let's take a look at how the wind affects the shots. On your screen there is a dotted line.
2001405	This dotted line is a radar item that helps you predict the path of your shot.
2001406	Try to hit those objects far away by using the radar. Don't forget, the path of your shot depends on the wind.
2001407	Shoot the other mobile!
2001408	Er... you missed it. Nice try though.This time, think about your angle and power.  Try again!
2001409	You hit it! Do you understand how the wind affects your shots? The wind can change often, so keep and eye on it.
2001410	Now let's learn about forces. The planet Lond has eight moons and each of them has different effects.
2001411	As moons rotate, abnormal climates occur and influence your shots.  These abnormal climates are called "force".
2001412	There are three kinds of forces. The first type is the pillar force. Every shot that passes through a pillar gets a special effect.
2001413	The climate forces influence nature.  They do things such as changing the wind or weakening the ground.
2001414	Lastly, there are these "Extra Force" which cause extremely abnormal phenomenon.
2001415	The different type of pillar forces are tornado, force, electricity, mirror and black force.
2001416	If a shot passes through a pillar, the shot becomes special. Try shooting something through the electric pillar.
2001417	Did you see that? The electricity directly affects your shot. Keep this in mind before you shoot.
2001418	Let's look at the climate forces.  The wind force alters the wind while the earth force increases land destruction.
2001419	Lastly, let's talk about the "Extra forces". These are ancient forces and are quite special.
2001420	Extra Forces include protection, ignorance and Thor. Protection increases recovery. Ignorance disables the use of items.
2001421	When the Thor force is active, Thor's Hammer will fire lasers. Let's see how Thor hammer works.
2001422	Does that make sense? Do you get the idea? Time for another pop quiz!
2001423	Get the answer right!
2001424	Which one of the followings is not a type of force?
2001425	1. Pillar Force
2001426	2. Climate Force
2001427	3. Extra Force
2001428	4. Special Force
2001429	That's incorrect. Shots that pass through the pillar force gets special effects, remember the electricity force?
2001430	Sorry, wrong answer. Climate forces change the wind or weaken the ground.
2001431	Um¡¦ no! Didn't you see what Thor's Hammer just did?
2001432	Right on! Special force is the name of an expendable item, not a type of force. Good job!
2001433	If you understand how forces work, you can use them for your advantage!
; Lesson 4	
2001600	Now let's talk about how to earn gold and gp. We'll also talk about how to win battles.
2001601	Depending on your performance, you will earn gold and gp.
2001602	For example, when you damage an opponent you earn gold and gp. Check this out!
2001603	If you do more than 250 damage to an opponent, it is a "good shot".  The amount of gold and gp you earn is shown on the top.
2001604	Damage your oppoenents in difficult situations to earn more gold and gp.
2001605	However, if you damage your team or yourself you lose gold and gp!
2001606	Get the answer right!
2001607	Which one of the following situations does not give you gold or gp?
2001608	1. Good shots.
2001609	2. Doing 1000 damage. 
2001610	3. Hitting an enemy through a tornado.
2001611	4. Suicide.
2001612	Are you paying attention!? A good shot means you damaged an opponent for 250 or above.  Didn't I just show you that?
2001613	Sorry, that's wrong. If you do that much damage you will definitely earn gold and gp.
2001614	Incorrect. Hitting an enemy through a tornado is a difficult shot and earns gold/gp.
2001615	That's right! Suicide hurts your team and yourself so you lose gold and gp.  Suicide is bad!
2001616	Now you know how to earn gp and gold.  Let's see how you win or lose the game.
2001617	It's actually pretty simple. Just beat your opponents before you get beaten!
2001618	There are two ways of doing this. One way is to damage your enemy until their energy reaches zero. This is called a "kill".
2001619	The other way is get rid of the ground where your enemy is standing. This is called a "bunge".
2001620	That's basically how you win... or lose if it your opponent does it to you.
2001621	Oh! I almost forgt! Winning and losing also depends on the game mode! We'll talk about this later.
2001622	Now, get ready for the thrill of victory! Hurry!  Make a "kill" or "bunge".
2001623	Disable your opponents!
2001624	Damage them until their energy reaches zero!
2001625	Destroy the ground underneath your opponent!
2001626	Awesome! You win! Now you know how to win and lose. 
; Lesson 5	
2001800	This lesson is about the different game modes.
2001801	There are five game modes:  Solo, Score, Tag, Jewel and Powerball. They are all similar, but slightly different.
2001802	In solo mode you battle until every opponent is damaged until zero.
2001803	Score mode is similar to solo mode except when you become disabled you can come back.
2001804	To win in score mode you need to bring your opponents' score to zero. The score is displayed on the bottom.
2001805	Everytime someone dies, that teams' score goes down by one. Disabled mobiles are removed from the map.
2001806	Dead players can click on a spot where they want to land. After several turns, players will land with full energy.
2001807	This means you can come back to the battle even if you die in score mode.
2001808	Be careful though! If all your team mates die at the same time, even if your score is not zero, your team loses.
2001809	So once you die, be quick and choose where you want to land back in the battle!
2001810	Here's a quick test! You have died in score mode, what do you do?  Hurry, get back in the game!
2001811	Disabled mobiles can come back into battle!
2001812	Click where you want to land back into battle.
2001813	Landing successful! It takes four turns to get back into battle during the real score mode!
2001814	You can always come back into battle as long as your team has points left.
2001815	Now let's look at tag mode. It is very similar to solo mode, but there are some differences.
2001816	In tag mode, you can switch between mobiles. You pick two mobiles at the beginning, before the game starts.
2001817	The first mobile you pick will have full energy while the second mobile will have half.
2001818	You will see the other mobile and the tag button on the bottom right.
2001819	You can switch between mobiles by clicking the tag button or pressing F7.
2001820	In the jewel mode the goal is to break jewels until you get 100 points.
2001821	You need to break jewels in order to get the points they carry.
2001822	There's no point in attacking other mobiles in this mode so focus on breaking jewels!
2001823	Finally, Powerball mode is similar to score mode.  However, instead of forces there are different "powerballs" in the game.
2001824	Powerballs fall from the sky, bounce around and the stop. If you can touch one of these, you will get a power up.
2001825	The type of power up is marked underneath your mobile.
2001826	You can have up to four different powerups at once. Isn't that amazing? So make sure to keep and eye on your power ups!
2001827	Also, the power ups will disappear after a few turns. It's too bad eh?
2001828	Time for another pop quiz!
2001829	How many powerups can you have at one time?
2001830	1. 1
2001831	2. 2
2001832	3. 3
2001833	4. 4
2001834	No¡¦ that would make power ball mode kind of boring.
2001835	Sorry, that's incorrect.
2001836	Nice try, but that is wrong.  Please try again.
2001837	Correct! You can have up to four power ups at once.
2001838	Now that you understand all the game modes, why don't you try them out?  Have some fun and play a few games!
; Lesson 6	
2002000	Now let's take a look at the mobiles.
2002001	First, you need to understand how to pick a mobile.
2002002	In the middle of the waiting room, there is a mobile button.  Click that button.
2002003	When you click the button, you will be able to choose a mobile.  
2002004	This is how you pick your mobile!
2002005	Don't forget, you can choose two different mobiles when you play tag mode.
2002006	This screen also gives you the offense, defense, and other stats for the mobiles.
2002007	Let's take a look at the different stats.
2002008	Below you will see a sword, shield, hourglass, and a tire.  Each stat is important, so let's look at each one!
2002009	The sword represents offense.  The higher, the stronger your attacks.
2002010	The shield represents defense.  The higher the gauge, the less damage you receive when you get hit.
2002011	The hourglass represents delay.  The higher the gauge, the higher your delay.
2002012	Remember, a high delay means you move later.  This isn't a good thing.
2002013	Finally, the tire represents how far a mobile can move. The higher the gauge, the further you can move.
2002014	Does that make sense?  I hope so, because it's time for another pop quiz.
2002015	Get the answer right!
2002016	Which one of the following symbols represents the stat for how far a mobile can move?
2002017	1. Sword
2002018	2. Shield
2002019	3. Hourglass
2002020	4. Tire
2002021	Nope! Where you paying attention? The sword represents offense.
2002022	Sorry, that's wrong.  The shield represents defense.
2002023	I'm sorry, that is incorrect. The hourglass represents delay.
2002024	Right on! The answer is tire. You pass the pop quiz!  That's it for this lesson.  Don't forget about your prize!
; Lesson 7	
2002200	Finally, some excitement.  Let's look at the different mobiles.  Pay attention!  This is going to be important.
2002201	Mobiles have offense and defense stats, but they also have different attributes.  Damage caused and received depends on them.
2002202	Weapon systems refer to the attributes of a mobile's shot. There are fire(explostion), laser, electrics and hit(strike) attributes.
2002203	Armor systems refer to the attributes of a mobile's defense. The different armor systems include steel(machine), shield and bio.
2002204	For weapon systems and armor systems, each type has its own advantages and disadvantages.
2002205	When there is a disadvantage, your shot does 4% less damage.  If there is an advantage, you get 4% extra damage.
2002206	Steel armor is strong against hit attacks, but weak against electric. Shield armor is powerful against laser but weak against strike.
2002207	Lastly, bionics have an advantage against electric attacks, but a disadvantage against laser attacks.
2002208	Fire(explosion) is an attribute that does not have any advantages of disadvantages.
2002209	I know, it's confusing. Once you understand the attributes, you reduce the damage you take and increase the damage you give.
2002210	Get the answer right!
2002211	It's that time again, time for a pop quiz! Which one of the followings attacks is weak against bionics?
2002212	1. Fire(explosion)
2002213	2. Laser
2002214	3. Electronic
2002215	4. Hit(strike)
2002216	No, that's wrong!  Explosion attacks do fixed damage, regardless of the armor system.
2002217	No! Laser attacks are week against steel(machine) amor systems.
2002218	That's right! Electric attacks are weak against bio armor systems.
2002219	Incorrect. Hit(strike) attacks are weak against steel(machine) amor systems.
2002220	Finally, let's look at the features of specific mobiles.
2002221	Mobiles with steel(machine) defense attributes are strong in defense.  Unforunately, they have little mobility and high delay.
2002222	Mobiles with shields get to recharge their shields to take more damage.  However, the max energy is low.
2002223	Bio mobiles make full use of recovery items, but they are the weakest in terms of defense.
2002224	So each mobile is different, keep that in mind!
2002225	Let's take a spin with each mobile!  We'll try all of them, so don't worry.
2002226	Pay attention to how the shots travel.
2002227	First is Armor.  Armor has high defense and shots that will destroy a wide portion of the ground.
2002228	Unfortunately, Armor has a high delay and little mobility. Let's try a few shots.
2002229	Let's practice shooting.  Try shot 1, shot 2 and SS shot!  Try each one once.
2002230	Nice job! Armor's shot 1 destroys a wide portion of the ground.
2002231	Well done! Did you see that? Armor's shot 2 digs into the ground and explodes twice.
2002232	Great! Armor's SS shot does a lot of damage if it hits!
2002233	That was Armor. Now let's take a look at Big Foot!
2002234	Big Foot fires a shower of shots so it has wide hitting range.
2002235	The shots scatter the further your attacks go.  This means it is not as effective against opponents far away.
2002236	Let's try a few shots with Big Foot.
2002237	Fire shot 1, shot 2 and SS shot!
2002238	Nice! Big Foot shot 1 fires four mid-sized missiles. Each shot is quite powerful too.
2002239	Good! Big Foot shot 2 fires six small missiles. Each shot is weak, but combined they can be very effective.
2002240	Big Foot's SS shot fires nine huge missiles. There is potential to do huge damage with the SS shot.
2002241	Now it's time for some Trico. Trico boasts some ground breaking power and strong explosions.
2002242	Some of the shots spin in the air, so it makes a direct hit very hard to do.
2002243	Give it a go for yourself!
2002244	Fire shot 1, shot 2 and SS shot!
2002245	Did you see? Shot 1 fires a single explosive shot. It's a pretty strong shot.
2002246	Shot 2 fires three explosive shots. The shots spin in the air so you got to get it just right for maximum damage.
2002247	Trico's SS shot has a wide attack range. It is very effective against enemies gathered close together.
2002248	Aduka has both electric and laser weapon systems. It can call upon Thor's power and become very powerful later on in the game.
2002249	However, it takes time for that power to kick in so it is weaker than other mobiles in the beginning.
2002250	Let's try a few rounds with Aduka.
2002251	Fire shot 1, shot 2 and SS shot!
2002252	Did you see that? It did damage two times. Shot 1 gives enemies an electric shock so it does damage twice.
2002253	Shot 2 calls Thor to attack by shooting three small adukas. You can raise the damage of Thor by hitting your opponent more.
2002254	Aduka's SS shot penetrates and travels through the ground so take advantage of this. It's possible to hit many enemies at once.
2002255	Now let's try Raon Launcher. Raon Launcher's shots are good at destroying the ground beneath your enemies.
2002256	However, the power of Raon's shots, even on direct hit, are not as strong as other mobiles.
2002257	Raon does has mini-robots though. They will approach nearby mobiles little by little every turn.
2002258	Take Raon Launcher for a sprin!
2002259	Try shot 1, shot 2 and SS shot!  Try each one once.
2002260	Did you see that? Shot 1 shoots three missiles at once. Since three shots hit one spot, it can dig some deep holes.
2002261	Did you see the mini-robots? Shot 2 fires two mini-robots. These robots will move closer to nearby mobiles around them.
2002262	Sweet! Raon's SS creeps around unil it hits an enemy. This means you don't need to make a direct hit.
2002263	How about we take a turn on Mage? Like other shield mobiles, Mage has a shield which slowly regenerates.
2002264	Mage also has a wide range and truly powerful shots.
2002265	Let's try a few rounds with Mage.
2002266	Try shot 1, shot 2 and SS shot!  Try each one once.
2002267	Awesome! Shot 1 fires a single laser.
2002268	Shot 2 fires twin lasers that move in a swirl.
2002269	Nice! Mage's SS shot gets rid of shieds for mobiles with shield defense systems.
2002270	A.Sate can be kind of confusing. Do you see that weirld looking thing above your head?
2002271	That's called a derivative and it is a weapon that shoots lasers wherever Sate points to.
2002272	It is really unique, but hard to use sometimes.
2002273	It gets harder for long distance shots because the lasers come from above your head.
2002274	See if you can get the hand of A.Sate.
2002275	Try shot 1, shot 2 and SS shot!  Try each one once.
2002276	Shot 1 is a single laser shot from the derivative when it is closer to the ground.
2002277	Wow! Shot 2 tells the derivative to fire three laser shots from a higher position.
2002278	Whoa! A.Sate's SS shot fires five lasers from the derivative even higher in the air.  The shots come down at a steeper angle.
2002279	This mobile is J.Frog. J.Frog look like a frog.  Obvious huh?
2002280	Depending on what shot you use, the shots roll to the left or right then explode.
2002281	It's easier to attack enemies on the ground but can be a little tricky when the terrain changes.
2002282	Give it a try.
2002283	Try shot 1, shot 2 and SS shot!  Give each one a shot.
2002284	Did you see that? Shot 1 rolls counter clockwise from where it sticks to the ground.
2002285	Great job! Unlike shot 1, shot 2 rolls clockwise.  Keep this in mind when you shoot.
2002286	J.Frog's SS shot will roll counter clockwise, doing damage while it rolls. This is useful if there are lots of opponents in a small area.
2002287	Let's meet Kalsodon. Kal can be powerful if you understand the shots.  Kal shots split into small missiles and come back together.
2002288	Because of how the shot works, it is best used with high angle shots.
2002289	If you don't get the right shot path, the damage tends to be kind of weak.
2002290	Try some high angle shots with Kalsidon!
2002291	Fire shot 1, shot 2 and SS shot!
2002292	Seems simple enough right? Shot 1 splits into two mid-sized missiles before coming back together.
2002293	Fantastic! Shot 2 splits into four small missiles.
2002294	That looks like it could hurt!! Kalsidon's SS shot splits twice. If every part hits, that's a lot of damage.
2002295	Who's next?  Oh yeah, let's look at J.D.  J.D. has good defense and a unique shot 2.
2002296	Because of this, J.D. is good at playing a support role on the team.
2002297	Let's try out some J.D. shots.
2002298	Fire shot 1, shot 2 and SS shot!
2002299	That's a pretty basic shot. Shot 1 gives an electric shock to your opponent's, causing some extra damage.
2002300	It might have been hard to tell, but J.D. shot 2 brings other mobiles closer to where the shot hit. It's useful for moving mobiles.
2002301	Nice. J.D.'s SS shot pushes mobiles away from where it lands.  Too bad it can't push players off the map.
2002302	Let's take a look at Lightning.  As the name suggest, Lightning has an electric weapon system.
2002303	Lightning calls upon the power of lighting to attack from the sky.
2002304	Because all the power of the shots comes from the sky, Lightning is weak on maps that have a ceiling or roof.
2002305	Go ahead and fire a few rounds to get the hang of it.
2002306	Fire shot 1, shot 2 and SS shot!
2002307	Does it make sense now? Shot 1 drops lightning straight down from the sky!
2002308	See that? Shot 2 drops down two lightning bolts that form a V.
2002309	Whoa, did you see that range? Lightning SS shot has a huge hit range.
2002310	Grub is a bionic mobile with shots that bounce around. This makes it good against people inside holes in the ground.
2002311	However, the shots are kind of weak unless they all make contact.
2002312	Bouncing shots will blow up after some time so make sure they get to the opponents quickly.
2002313	Let's see what Grub is capable of!
2002314	Try shot 1, shot 2 and SS shot!  Use each one once.
2002315	Shot 1 is a pretty normal shot. It can be used pretty easily.
2002316	Alright! Grub's shot 2 fires four bouncing shots at once.  It's possible to bounce them off walls too.
2002317	It was kind of hard to tell, but Grub's SS shot does damage while it's moving also. It's great if you can get it into a small hole.
2002318	Meet Nak! Nak is really strong and also has also has a special skill.
2002319	Nak has vibration shots that travel underground before exploding.
2002320	Unfortunately, Nak has low mobility and takes some getting used to.
2002321	Have some fun with Nak! See what you can do.
2002322	Try shot 1, shot 2 and SS shot!  Try each one once.
2002323	Shot 1 fires a regular shot. It is pretty simple and has no advantage or disadvantage.
2002324	Shot 2 can be tricky. Did you see it travel through the ground before exploding? Keep that in mind when you use Nak.
2002325	Nak's SS will travel through the ground like Aduka's, but Nak's won't travel through mobiles so it's harder to hit multiple targets.
2002326	Now we are getting tricky.  Boomer is a tough mobile to master.  Fortunately, Boomer has a really wide angle for making shots.
2002327	Boomer is kind of weak and is very vulnerable to the wind.
2002328	Let's take Boomer out for a spin.
2002329	Fire shot 1, shot 2 and SS shot!
2002330	Nice. Boomer's shot 1 throws a single boomerang. Since it's a boomerang, it is affected a lot by the wind so be careful.
2002331	Cool! Shot 2 is similar to shot 1 but it fires four boomerangs at once. If you can hit with all four that's quite a bit of damage.
2002332	Ah! Did you see it? Boomer's SS shot unfolds into a golden boomerang after a while.  It needs to unfold for maximum damage!
2002333	This is Ice. Ice looks like Mammoth and fires ice. Obvious huh?
2002334	Ice also has the ability to decrease mobile defenses.
2002335	You can decrease other mobile's defenses by up to 50%. Once a defence system is lowerd, it stays lowered until the game ends.
2002336	Try it for yourself.
2002337	Fire shot 1, shot 2 and SS shot!
2002338	Good job! Ice's shot 1 fires a shard of ice. It can destroy a lot of ground.
2002339	Snowballs! If another mobile is hit with Ice's shot 2, their defense system will decrease by 5%.
2002340	Ice's SS shot is similar to shot 2. It can decrease a mobile's defence systems by 5%.
2002341	Finally, let's take a look at Turtle. See that shell? It must be good for defense.
2002342	On top of that, Turtle is pretty good with long distance high angle shots.
2002343	Hmm... Turtle moves slow. Don't they all though? The mobility is very low.
2002344	Does that make sense?  Give it a go yourself!
2002345	One last time, let's try shot 1, shot 2 and SS shot!  Try each one once.
2002346	That was pretty basic. Turtle's shot 1 is not very special but relatively strong.
2002347	Shot 2 is where Turtle excels! It's similar to Mage shot 2, but the twin shots stop twirling after a distance. Try it with a high angle!
2002348	Ok, it's pretty tricky. Turtle's SS shot fires a big huge water drop that will split into multiple attacks after a certain period of time.
2002349	Phew!  That was a lot of info!  Hopefully now you understand the difference between mobiles. Well, that's all for this lesson!
; Lesson 8	
2002400	Next, let's hear about avatars! Avatars are items you wear to decorate yourself. Sometimes they give you additional stats.
2002401	You buy and wear avatars from the avatar shop. You can enter the avatar shop by clicking the button on the right.
2002402	Click the avatar shop button to enter the avatar shop.
2002403	This is where you buy, try on, and wear avatars. Avatars are divided into head, body, glass, flag and EX item categories.
2002404	Each item is worn on different parts. Let's take a look at them.
2002405	Head avatars are¡¦ Well, for your head.
2002406	Items also have their own stats so they can help during battle.
2002407	Body avatar items are worn on the body. Think of it like a shirt.
2002408	Glass avatars items are for your face, shoulders or hands.  It will depend on the item.
2002409	Think of flag avatar items as an accessory. You will see the item behind you when you wear them.
2002410	Sets are packages of avatars including head, body, glasses and flag.
2002411	You get a discount so it is cheaper than buying them individually.
2002412	EX items include all other items. You can buy expendable items to help in battle.
2002413	There are also background and mascot items for showing off when waiting for games to start.
2002414	That's pretty much it. It's a little difficult, but important. Avatars can really help you out!
2002415	Right, so that's it¡¦ Pop quiz time!
2002416	Get the answer right!
2002417	Which type of avatar items do not change your stats?
2002418	1. Head Avatar Items
2002419	2. Flag Avatar Items
2002420	3. Glass Avatar Items
2002421	4. EX Items
2002422	Man, you need to pay attention!  Try again¡¦
2002423	Wrong. Think, which type of avatar item is not worn?
2002424	Nope, sorry.  Try again.
2002425	Good job! EX items include expendable and decoration items.
2002426	Now that you know a little about avatars, let's learn a little bit more about stats.
2002427	Pay attention! I'm going to give you a quiz afterwards.
2002428	There area total of eight different stats. The stats change the abilities of your mobile.
2002429	The stats are Delay, Digging Power, Offense, Energy, Deffense, Item Delay, Shield Recovery and Popularity.
2002430	Delay determines a mobile's delay. '-' lowers delay and '+' increases delay.
2002431	Digging Power determines how much ground your shots destroy. '+' means more ground and '-' means less ground.
2002432	Offense determines a mobile's offense.
2002433	Energy determines a mobile's energy.
2002434	Defense determines a mobile's defense. For all those stats '+' increases and '-' lowers the stat.
2002435	Item Delay affects the delay you get from using an item.
2002436	Just like Delay '-' lowers delay and '+' increases delay.
2002437	Shield Recovery applies to shield defense systems only. It effects shield regeneration.
2002438	Popularity effects how much gold you earn. For Shield Recovery and Popularity '+' increases and '-' decreases the stat.
2002439	That pretty much explains all the stats.
2002440	Remember to keep the stats in mind since they can help you win!
2002441	Get the answer right!
2002442	Here's the quiz I promised you. Which stat effects how much gold you earn?
2002443	1. Offense
2002444	2. Defense
2002445	3. Item Delay
2002446	4. Popularity
2002447	I told you to pay attention! Offense changes a mobile's attack power.
2002448	No, that's wrong. Defense changes a mobile's defense.  Isn't that obvious?
2002449	Try again. Item Delay effects the delay from using an item.
2002450	That's right! If you have a higher popularity, you will earn more gold.
2002451	Now that you know about avatars, I'll teach you how to put them on.
2002452	You see that area on your right? That's where you see what avatars you have.
2002453	Wearable avatar items are listed first. Click the buttons to sort your inventory.
2002454	To wear an item just double click the item you want to wear. Easy huh?
2002455	For wearable items, you can wear one item of each type. Sorry, you can't have two heads.
2002456	Double click on items to take them off.
2002457	If you want to see your backgrounds or EX items, click here.
2002458	In the same way, double click items to equip them.
2002459	That's pretty much it. Practice wearing a head item so you get the hang of it.
2002460	Equip a head avatar item.
2002461	Double click on the item you want to wear.
2002462	Great job! You will see your character is now wearing a head item.
2002463	Get many different items to make yourself look cooler. Find a combination that suits you best.
; Lesson 9	
2002600	You've come a long and now we are at the final lesson. Get ready for a battle!
2002601	Now that you're no longer a newbie, you should have no problem with this one.
2002602	Finish this final lesson I'll give you a final prize. Good luck!
2002603	In this lesson you will have to defeat Raon. Load up some items before you start!
2002604	The battle will start right after you pick your mobile. Make sure you are ready then select your mobile!
2002605	Defeat Raon!
2002606	Don't give up! Damage him more to defeat him!
2002607	Good shot!
2002608	Ouch! Be careful!
2002609	Watch out!
2002610	Raon defeated! Great job! That's all the lessons I have for you¡¦ I'm so proud of you!
2002611	Now let's see how you fair against other players. Go try a few games, and don't forget what you've learned. Best of luck!
